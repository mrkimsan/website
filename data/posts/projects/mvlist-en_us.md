# mvlist

When I built this, I wanted an easy way to keep track of movies I wanted to watch. This web app provides an easy way to do that, with a watchlist, a view where you can see what movies on your list are upcoming, you can keep track of "up next", and it also shows movies you've recently watched.

Apparently, letterboxHD wasn't good enough for me at the time. Awesome.

The project is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jipfr/mvlist). Check out the live version at [mvlist.jipfr.nl](https://mvlist.jipfr.nl)
