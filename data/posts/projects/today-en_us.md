# Today for Makerlog

Today is a client I built for Makerlog, a community you can use to easily keep track of your todos, and view what you've done recently. You can check it out [here](https://getmakerlog.com).

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jipfr/today). A live version is available at [today.jipfr.nl](https://today.jipfr.nl)
